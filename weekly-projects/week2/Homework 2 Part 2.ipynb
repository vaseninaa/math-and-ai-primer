    "# Health-care assistance via probabilistic graphical modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "In this project, you will create a health-care assistance bot that can suggest diagnoses for a set of symptoms based on a probabilistic graphical model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Review \n",
    "Review the code from the Bayesian networks exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Acquire data\n",
    "View this [research article](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms5212) and download its supplementary data sets 1, 2 and 3. These data sets include the occurrences of diseases, symptoms, and their co-occurrences in the scientific literature. (For the purpose of this exercise, we are going to assume that the frequency of co-occurrences of diseases and symptoms in scientific papers is proportional to the co-occurence frequencies of actual disease cases and symptoms.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Create a Bayesian network\n",
    "Using commands from the `pgmpy` library, create a Bayesian network in which the probability of exhibiting a symptom is conditional on the probability of having an associated disease. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Initialize priors\n",
    "Use the disease occurrence data to assign prior probabilities for diseases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Calculate conditional probability tables\n",
    "Use the co-occurrence data to define CPTs for each connected pair of disease and symptoms. (Hint: You may need to assign some occurrences of symptoms to an \"idiopathic disease\" to create valid CPTs.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6:\n",
    "Create a minimal interface in which your bot asks a users for a list of observed symptoms and then returns the name of the disease that is the most likely match to the symptoms. (Hint: Review the input/output commands that you have used in last week's homework.)"
